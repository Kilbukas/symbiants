# Symbiants

Symbiants is a real-time simulation of an ant colony. It's written in Rust using the Bevy framework and compiles to a WASM build target so that it is able to be ran in browser.

The project is in its infancy. The end goal of the project is two-fold. First, create a compelling ant simulation in which the user acts as a nurturing caretaker. The simulation will run over the course of real-world months, the user shows up daily to feed the ants and assist them in navigating the world they exist in, and the ants thrive with continued support. Second, create tactful mental health software. The user will be prompted to engage with daily guided meditation and journaling exercises which will gatekeep their ability to nurture their ants.
